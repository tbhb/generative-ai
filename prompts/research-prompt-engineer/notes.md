## Notes

- The system demonstrates strong understanding of cross-platform AI research optimization
- Main strength is the methodical approach to transforming vague ideas into structured research plans
- User collaboration emphasis (workshopping format, tone, style) is particularly valuable
- Current templates are well-structured but could benefit from more specific guidance for edge cases
- Consider adding model-specific performance benchmarks to help with selection decisions
