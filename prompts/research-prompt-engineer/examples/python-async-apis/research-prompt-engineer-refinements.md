3. **Depth → Delivery:** Gemini (research) → Claude/ChatGPT (client format)

### Workflow Documentation Requirements
- Always document platform switching rationale
- Track context window limitations encountered
- Note quality improvements from multi-stage processing
```

### 3. Enhanced Format Workshopping Process

**Current Issue:** Format preferences not thoroughly validated against model capabilities
**Proposed Enhancement:**

```markdown
## Advanced Format Validation

### Format-Model Compatibility Matrix
Before finalizing format selection, assess:

| Format Type | Claude Family | ChatGPT Family | Gemini Family | Recommendation |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Annotated Bibliography | Excellent | Excellent | Poor | Claude/ChatGPT only |
| Academic Papers | Good | Good | Exceptional | Any model |
| Executive Reports | Excellent | Excellent | Good | Claude/ChatGPT preferred |
| Technical Analyses | Excellent | Good | Exceptional | Claude or Gemini |

### Format Risk Assessment
For each format choice, explicitly discuss:
- **Model Compatibility Risk:** How well does target model handle this format?
- **Conversion Effort:** If format fails, how much work to fix?
- **Quality Trade-offs:** What capabilities might be lost/gained?
```

### 4. Enhanced Limitation Documentation

**Current Issue:** Generic disclaimers without specific model considerations
**Proposed Enhancement:**

```markdown
## Model-Specific Limitations and Caveats

### Claude Family Limitations
- **Context Windows:** May require document chunking for large comparisons
- **Multi-agent Coordination:** Slower execution but higher quality
- **Conservative Approach:** May request clarification when others proceed

### ChatGPT Family Limitations
- **Technical Depth:** Good but not exceptional compared to Gemini
- **Systematic Approach:** Reliable but potentially less innovative
- **Format Focus:** May sacrifice some content depth for structure

### Gemini Family Limitations
- **Format Adherence:** Consistent academic paper bias regardless of instructions
- **Conversion Required:** Plan for substantial post-processing effort
- **Integration Challenges:** May not follow structured requirements precisely

### Universal Limitations
- **Single Domain Testing:** All recommendations based on technical research task
- **Temporal Snapshot:** Model capabilities evolve rapidly

```

### 5. Quality Validation Protocols

**Current Issue:** Limited guidance on validating multi-model workflows
**Proposed Addition:**

```markdown
## Multi-Model Quality Assurance

### Cross-Validation Strategies
1. **Source Verification:** Compare source quality across models
2. **Technical Accuracy:** Validate claims against authoritative sources
3. **Completeness Assessment:** Ensure all research objectives addressed
4. **Format Compliance:** Verify deliverable meets exact specifications

### Red Flags for Model Selection Errors
- **Format Non-Compliance:** Gemini generating academic papers for bibliography requests
- **Technical Superficiality:** ChatGPT models lacking depth for complex topics
- **Context Overload:** Claude hitting limits during large document analysis
- **Inconsistent Quality:** Significant variation in output quality across attempts

### Recovery Strategies
- **Format Failure:** Switch to Claude/ChatGPT families
- **Depth Insufficiency:** Switch to Gemini family
- **Context Limits:** Implement multi-stage processing
