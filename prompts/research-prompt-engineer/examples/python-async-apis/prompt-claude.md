</synthesis_requirements>

<context>
This research targets Python developers building REST API clients for production-grade distributed request processing architectures such as web scrapers, API aggregation services, data pipelines, and microservice integrations. The focus is on practical usage of existing async HTTP libraries (httpx, aiohttp, etc.) rather than building new HTTP libraries from scratch.

The research should assume expert-level Python knowledge and focus on advanced async patterns for API client development that go beyond basic tutorial examples. Consider the unique challenges of API client implementations: handling rate limits, managing connection pools across many concurrent requests, processing streaming responses, integrating with larger async applications, and maintaining performance under high load.

Prioritize sources that demonstrate real-world usage patterns, production deployment experiences, and performance optimization techniques specifically for async API client development using established libraries.
