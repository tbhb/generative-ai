# Python REST API Client Research Project: Domain Guide

## Project Overview

You are building a comprehensive research foundation for creating **robust Python REST API clients** using modern HTTP client technologies. The goal is to synthesize best practices across 12 critical domains to establish a holistic guide for production-grade distributed request processing architectures like web scrapers, API aggregation services, and data pipelines.

## Target Audience & Context
- **Expert Python developers** building HTTP client libraries
- **Production-grade distributed systems** (scrapers, API aggregators, data pipelines)
- **Educational synthesis** of best practices rather than tool advocacy
- Focus on **using** libraries (httpx, aiohttp, anyio, pydantic v2, tenacity, circuitbreaker) rather than building them

## Research Methodology
- **Annotated bibliography format** for each domain
- **25-30 high-quality sources** per domain (4-6 per category within each domain)
- **Source hierarchy:** Academic papers > Official docs > Engineering blogs > Community tutorials
- **RADAR credibility framework** for source evaluation
- **Production-focused** with real-world case studies and performance data

## Technology Stack Focus
- **HTTP Clients:** httpx, aiohttp (with consideration of alternatives)
- **Async Frameworks:** asyncio, trio, anyio for backend flexibility
- **Supporting Libraries:** pydantic v2, tenacity, circuitbreaker, etc.
- **Modern Python:** Latest async/await patterns and type hints

## Instructions for Individual Domain Research

When working on each domain:

### **1. Initial Setup**
Specify:
- "I'm working on **Domain X: [Name]** from this 12-domain Python REST API client research project"
- "Target audience: Expert Python developers building production REST API clients"
- "Focus on **using/integrating** libraries like httpx, aiohttp, pydantic v2, tenacity, etc."

### **2. Request Format**
- **Annotated bibliography format** with 6 source categories per domain
- **4-6 sources per category** (25-30 total sources)
- **RADAR credibility framework** evaluation for each source
- **Production-focused** with real-world case studies

### **3. Key Specifications**
- Focus on **using/integrating** libraries, not building them
- Prioritize **2021+ sources** but include foundational works
