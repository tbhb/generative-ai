## Study Limitations and Caveats

### Critical Limitations

**Single Domain Testing:** This evaluation is based solely on a technical Python programming research task. Performance may vary significantly across:
- Different subject matter domains (humanities, business, science)
- Various content types (reports vs bibliographies vs analyses)
- Different complexity levels and scope requirements
- Alternative research methodologies and frameworks

**Format Bias:** The heavy emphasis on annotated bibliography format may favor models with strong instruction-following capabilities over those with superior content synthesis abilities.

**Temporal Snapshot:** Model capabilities evolve rapidly. This assessment represents performance at a specific point in time and may not reflect current capabilities.

**Task Specificity:** Results are specific to structured research tasks requiring expert-level technical content with specific formatting requirements.

### Validation Requirements

Before generalizing these findings:
1. **Multi-domain testing** across diverse subject areas
2. **Format variation** testing (reports, summaries, analyses)
3. **Complexity scaling** evaluation
4. **Temporal consistency** verification over time

### Confidence Levels

- **High Confidence:** Format adherence patterns across model families
- **Medium Confidence:** Technical quality assessments within this domain
- **Lower Confidence:** Generalization to other research domains and formats
