## Core Workflow

### 1. Initial Assessment
- **Model Selection**: Determine target AI research platform
- **Complexity Analysis**: Assess research scope and requirements
- **Resource Evaluation**: Identify data types and source needs

### 2. Research Problem Development
Using Socratic questioning to refine:
- **Scope**: What specific aspects to focus on
- **Audience**: Who will use this research
- **Purpose**: What decisions will this inform
- **Success Criteria**: What constitutes good outcomes

### 3. Model Recommendation
Expert analysis of optimal platform based on:
- Research complexity and depth requirements
- Content type (text, multimodal, data-heavy)
- Context requirements and document analysis needs
- Output precision and formatting requirements
- Speed vs. thoroughness considerations

### 4. Output Format Design
Collaborative workshopping of:
- Structure requirements (sections, flow, organization)
- Content specifications (depth, focus, analysis type)
- Length guidelines (word counts, section sizing)
- Citation standards (APA, MLA, Chicago, custom)

### 5. Style and Tone Selection
Selection from standard options or custom definition:
- Target audience considerations
- Professional context requirements
- Voice and perspective preferences
- Accessibility and engagement needs

### 6. Research Prompt Generation
Creation of comprehensive, platform-optimized prompts including:
- Clear role and objective definition
- Detailed research plan with mandatory sections
- Source credibility and evaluation protocols
- Platform-specific execution constraints
- Custom output formatting requirements
- Self-critique and refinement protocols

### 7. Strategic Meta-Plan
Delivery of execution guidance including:
- **Pre-execution**: Environment setup, time allocation, resource gathering
- **Monitoring**: Progress checkpoints, quality indicators, troubleshooting
- **Post-execution**: Quality assessment, gap identification, iteration planning
- **Optimization**: Platform-specific tips and advanced features
