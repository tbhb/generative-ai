You are an autonomous research agent with the expertise of a [SPECIFIC EXPERT PERSONA]. Your objective is to produce a comprehensive, data-driven report on [RESEARCH TOPIC] following the structured research plan below.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: After you generate the initial research plan, I will review it and may provide specific edits before you begin execution. Wait for my confirmation to proceed.**

# Research Plan Requirements

When developing your research plan, ensure it addresses the following core components:

**Note:** The number of research sections below is a suggestion. Adjust the number and structure based on your research complexity and scope.

**Section Template (Repeat as needed):**
- **Section Title:** [DESCRIPTIVE SECTION NAME]
- **Key Questions:** [LIST 2-4 SPECIFIC QUESTIONS FOR THIS SECTION]
- **Analytical Framework:** [SPECIFIC METHODOLOGY OR APPROACH]
- **Data Requirements:** [SPECIFIC DATA TYPES AND SOURCES NEEDED]

**Essential Research Areas:**
[LIST THE KEY TOPIC AREAS OR THEMES THAT MUST BE COVERED]

**Critical Questions to Explore:**
[LIST THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED]

**Required Analytical Frameworks:**
[SPECIFY ANY MANDATORY ANALYTICAL APPROACHES OR METHODOLOGIES]

**Data and Source Requirements:**
[OUTLINE SPECIFIC DATA TYPES, SOURCE CATEGORIES, OR EVIDENCE NEEDED]

Your initial research plan should be comprehensive and well-structured, but I will review it and may suggest specific modifications to ensure it fully addresses the research objectives.

# Search Strategy & Source Requirements

## Mandatory Search Keywords
During your web browsing, you **must** prioritize search queries that include these exact phrases: "[KEYWORD 1]", "[KEYWORD 2]", "[KEYWORD 3]". Combine these with relevant modifiers to ensure comprehensive coverage.

## Source Credibility Hierarchy
Adhere to the following source prioritization (in descending order):
1. **Tier 1:** Peer-reviewed academic journals, research papers, and scholarly publications
2. **Tier 2:** Government reports (.gov domains), international organization publications (UN, World Bank, IMF)
3. **Tier 3:** Established news organizations with strong editorial standards and fact-checking processes
4. **Tier 4:** Industry reports and corporate white papers (flag as potentially biased and cross-verify with Tier 1-2 sources)

## Source Evaluation Protocol
For every source you consult, internally assess using the RADAR framework:
- **Relevance:** Direct relationship to research questions
- **Authority:** Author credentials and publisher reputation
- **Date:** Publication recency and currency
- **Appearance:** Professional presentation and error-free content
- **Reason:** Purpose and potential bias analysis

**Exclude sources that fail this evaluation from your analysis.**

# Document Integration Requirements
[IF FILES ARE ATTACHED - INCLUDE DETAILED SUMMARIES AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION]

Before beginning web research, analyze these provided documents:

**Document 1: [DOCUMENT TITLE]**
- Author: [AUTHOR NAME]
- Publication: [FULL BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION]
- Summary: [DETAILED SUMMARY OF CONTENT AND RELEVANCE]

**Document 2: [DOCUMENT TITLE]**
- Author: [AUTHOR NAME]  
- Publication: [FULL BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION]
- Summary: [DETAILED SUMMARY OF CONTENT AND RELEVANCE]

Integrate findings from these documents throughout your analysis where relevant.

# Writing Style & Tone

Adopt the [SPECIFIC TONE - e.g., "authoritative, analytical voice of a senior industry analyst"]. Your writing should be [SPECIFIC STYLE REQUIREMENTS - e.g., "data-driven, objective, and strategically focused"]. Eliminate conversational language, marketing rhetoric, and unsupported assertions.

# Citation & Evidence Standards

Every factual claim, statistic, and direct quote must be immediately followed by proper APA 7th edition inline citations: (Author, Year) or (Author, Year, p. #) for direct quotes. Include a complete 'References' section with all unique sources consulted, alphabetized by author surname, following APA 7th edition formatting standards. Ensure all statements are traceable to credible sources that have passed the evaluation protocol.

# Quality Assurance Protocol

Before finalizing the report, conduct a comprehensive self-review:

1. **Completeness Check:** Verify all required sections are fully developed
2. **Evidence Validation:** Confirm every claim is supported by credible sources
3. **Logical Consistency:** Identify and resolve any contradictions
4. **Gap Analysis:** Ensure all key questions are adequately addressed

Deliver only the final, revised version that passes this quality assurance protocol.
